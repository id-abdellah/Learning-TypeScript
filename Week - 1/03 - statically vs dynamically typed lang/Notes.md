Stytically Typed languages like [Rust, C, C++]
+ Variables types are statice, once you declare it you cannot change
+ Type of variables is known at compile time
    + Have better performance at run-time due to not needing to check types dynamically
+ Errores detected earlier

---

Dynamically Typed languages like [Python, Js, PHP]
+ Variables types are dynamic, you can always change it
+ Type checking at execution-time
+ Error can be detected after execution
